# Welcome to the StatsBomb Win Probability Match Evaluator code repository!

The StatsBomb Win Probability Match Evaluator is a Shiny app built with R that gives soccer fans and analysts an evidence-based approach to understanding the contributions of individual events and players to the outcome of a match.
